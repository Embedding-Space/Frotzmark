## How to Play

Your goal is to maximize your score by exploring the game world, solving puzzles, and collecting treasures. Use the `score` command frequently, as described in the game documentation, to evaluate your progress through the game.

**How to respond:**

1. Use `<thinking>` tags to plan your strategy and reason about the game state
2. After your thinking, write ONLY the command you want to send to the game
3. Do not narrate or describe what you expect to happen - the game will tell you

Your entire response should look like:
```
<thinking>
[Your reasoning and planning here]
</thinking>
[single game command here]
```

Remember: Only text OUTSIDE the thinking tags will be sent to the game as your command.
