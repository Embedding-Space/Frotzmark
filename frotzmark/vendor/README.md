xyppy is a Z-machine interpreter written in Python. We vendor it to ensure:
- Long-term reproducibility of research results
- Independence from upstream changes or repository availability
- Explicit control over the exact version used in experiments

### Why vendored instead of dependency?

For academic/research software, vendoring critical dependencies ensures that experiments remain reproducible years into the future, regardless of changes to upstream repositories or package availability.

### Modifications

Currently using xyppy unmodified. We provide our own `Screen` implementation for programmatic control of game I/O, but the core Z-machine implementation remains unchanged.
